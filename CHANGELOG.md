# Change Log
All notable changes to this project are documented below.

The format is based on [keep a changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) and this project uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### Unreleased

### [2.5.3]

### Fixed
- Nakama and Satori ESM module files now correctly end in the `.mjs` extension.

### [2.5.1]

### Added
- Added [Satori](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/satori) client package (`satori-js`)

### Changed
- Remove Yarn in favour of NPM and updates dependencies to support Node 18 LTS

### [2.4.1]

### Fixed
- This release is a republish of 2.4.0 but with the `cjs` distribution provided.

### [2.4.0]

### Added
- Added more details comments and documentation on objects and methods.

### Changed
- Changed data structure used to pass session variables to authentication methods. The old structure used was a `Map<string, string>`. We now use the `Record<string, string>` for serialization support.
- Changed `StreamData.stream_presence` to `StreamData.sender`. This field should be populated correctly now.
- Changed `MatchData.presences` to a singular `MatchData.presence`. This presence represents the sender. This field should be populated correctly now.
- Match and party data payloads are now serialized as protobuf when using the protobuf adapter.
    - Because of this change, `sendMatchState` and `sendPartyData` can now receive bytes as input. If bytes are sent using the default text adapter, they are base64 encoded to a string.
       - These functions can no longer receive data payloads of type `any`. Any object previously passed in must be serialized to a string or bytes. This change is enforced at compile time.
    - Also due to this change, `MatchData` and `PartyData` have their `data` fields typed as a `Uint8Array`. This breaks
    backwards compatibility. Users who send a string as their match or party data will need to use a utility such as `TextDecoder` to deserialize the string. This change is enforced at compile time.

### Fixed
- Fixed an issue with our base64 dependency in React Native.

### [2.3.0]

### Fixed
- Fixed 401 Unauthorized Responses from the server in response to `rpcHttpKey`.

### Changed
- Changed parameter list optionals and sequencing in `rpcHttpKey`.
    - The signature is now listed as follows: `rpcHttpKey(httpKey: string, id: string, input?: object);`

- Renamed `ApiOverrideOperator` to `ApiOperator`.
- Query params are now formatted with snake case rather than camel case internally by client.

### [2.2.0]

### Added
- Added purchase validation for Apple, Google and Huawei.
- Added an `ApiOverrideOperator` to leaderboard writes.
- Added ability to logout of a session with `sessionLogout`.
- Added realtime party support.
- Added ability to import steam friends through `importSteamFriends`.

### Changed
- Removes the deprecated generalist `socket.Send` function for sending data. Use the other exported Socket methods
such as `socket.addMatchmaker` for better type checking.
- Changed the return type from `socket.addMatchmaker` to a `MatchmakerTicket` rather than a `MatchmakerMatched`.
- Changed signature of `authenticateSteam` and `linkSteam` to allow for a `sync` option.
- Upgraded ts-proto dependency and shipped type definitions with the protobuf adapter.
- Sessions that are close to expiration will now be automatically refreshed. You can configure this behavior
via the `autoRefreshSession` parameter in the `Client` constructor and the `expiredTimespanMs` expiration buffer value on the client.
- Removed `session` parameter from `rpcGet` and renamed it to `rpcHttpKey`. This function should be used with an http key rather than a session.

### Fixed
- 401 Unauthorized errors while renewing sessions.

### [2.1.7]
### Fixed
- Fixed cacheable cursor parsing in `ChannelMessageList`.

### [2.1.6]
### Added
- Added a cachable cursor to `ChannelMessageList`.

### [2.1.5]
### Fixed
- Fixed issue where rollup.js was not bundling in js-base64 library to UMD distribution.

### [2.1.4]

### Added
- Added React Native integration example to packages/ folder. The example builds
for iOS and Android.

### Fixed

- Authenticate methods now properly accept "create" and "username" parameters for email, Gamecenter, device, and Steam methods.

### Changed

## [2.1.3]
### Added
- Added Webpack and Create React App integration examples to packages/ folder.

### Changed
- Canonical import examples no longer reference a single exported object.
- Moved tests to their own workspace and upgraded Jest dependencies.

### Fixed
